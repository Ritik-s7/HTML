        <b>Cricket</b> is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven
        players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch
        with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three
        stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the
        <i>bowler</i>, "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch
        towards the wicket at the other end. The batting side's players score
        runs by striking the bowled ball with a bat and running between the
        wickets, while the bowling side tries to prevent this by keeping the
        ball within the field and getting it to either wicket, and dismiss each
        batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled,
        when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the
        fielding side either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground,
        or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease
        line in front of the wicket to complete a run. When ten batters have
        been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is
        adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in
        international matches.

        Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a
        single innings of 20 overs and the game generally lasting three hours,
        to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in
        all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team
        colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear
        to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid
        made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a
        cork core layered with tightly wound string.

      <h3>Growth of amateur and professional cricket in England</h3>
      <p>
        Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most
        runs, the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain
        key technical aspects; the North American variant of cricket known as
        wicket retained many of these aspects.[14] The ball was bowled underarm
        by the bowler and along the ground towards a batsman armed with a bat
        that in shape resembled a hockey stick; the batsman defended a low,
        two-stump wicket; and runs were called notches because the scorers
        recorded them by notching tally sticks.[15][16][17] In 1611, the year
        Cotgrave's dictionary was published, ecclesiastical court records at
        Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners, Bartholomew Wyatt and
        Richard Latter, failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they
        were playing cricket. They were fined 12d each and ordered to do
        penance.[18] This is the earliest mention of adult participation in
        cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known
        organised inter-parish or village match was played – at Chevening,
        Kent.[6][19] In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was
        accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish teams
        in Sussex.[20] Cricket remained a low-key local pursuit for much of the
        17th century.[10] It is known, through numerous references found in the
        records of ecclesiastical court cases, to have been proscribed at times
        by the Puritans before and during the Commonwealth. [21][22] The problem
        was nearly always the issue of Sunday play as the Puritans considered
        cricket to be "profane" if played on the Sabbath, especially if large
        crowds or gambling were involved.[23][24] According to the social
        historian Derek Birley, there was a "great upsurge of sport after the
        Restoration" in 1660.[25] Gambling on sport became a problem significant
        enough for Parliament to pass the 1664 Gambling Act, limiting stakes to
        £100 which was, in any case, a colossal sum exceeding the annual income
        of 99% of the population.[25] Along with prizefighting, horse racing and
        blood sports, cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport.[26] Rich
        patrons made matches for high stakes, forming teams in which they
        engaged the first professional players.[27] By the end of the century,
        cricket had developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout
        England and was already being taken abroad by English mariners and
        colonisers – the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated
        1676.[28] A 1697 newspaper report survives of "a great cricket match"
        played in Sussex "for fifty guineas apiece" – this is the earliest known
        contest that is generally considered a First Class match.[29][30] The
        patrons, and other players from the social class known as the "gentry",
        began to classify themselves as "amateurs"[fn 1] to establish a clear
        distinction from the professionals, who were invariably members of the
        working class, even to the point of having separate changing and dining
        facilities.[31] The gentry, including such high-ranking nobles as the
        Dukes of Richmond, exerted their honour code of noblesse oblige to claim
        rights of leadership in any sporting contests they took part in,
        especially as it was necessary for them to play alongside their "social
        inferiors" if they were to win their bets.[32] In time, a perception
        took hold that the typical amateur who played in first-class cricket,
        until 1962 when amateurism was abolished, was someone with a public
        school education who had then gone to one of Cambridge or Oxford
        University – society insisted that such people were "officers and
        gentlemen" whose destiny was to provide leadership.[33] In a purely
        financial sense, the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim
        expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played under
        contract and was paid a wage or match fee; in practice, many amateurs
        claimed more than actual expenditure and the derisive term "shamateur"
        was coined to describe the practice.[34][35]
